Official implement of [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13917)

## Data

Download from this [link](https://github.com/TaoShi1998/MultiEMO/tree/main/Data), and put them into Dataset folder.

## Run

```
# IEMOCAP Dataset
bash Train/TrainSpikEmo_IEMOCAP.sh

# MELD Dataset
bash Train/TrainSpikEmo_MELD.sh
```

## Thanks

The code builds upon the frameworks originally developed in the [MultiEMO](https://github.com/TaoShi1998/MultiEMO.git) and [Spikformer](https://github.com/ZK-Zhou/spikformer.git).
